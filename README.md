# EC2 Gitlab Runner

This repository holds the terraform description of reusable scalable gitlab runner hosted on t2.micro AWS EC2.

The Gitlab runner is hosted on EC2 spot instances in order to reduce costs and make use from the free tier at maximum (Spot instances can reduce ec2 costs almost to 90%), we make use of the unused Amazon EC2 cloud capacity based on spot instances requests, meanwhile if Amazon reclaim back the spot instance a new requests for another one will be created automatically through persistent spot requests to ensure availability of the runner's host.


##  Structure

| **Root Directory** ||
|------ |--- |
|main.tf|Initialization ofthe reusable ec2-gb-runner module to create as many as needed instances and set configuration variables in the initialization) |
|output.tf|Display what to output after applying changes) |
|       ***/ec2-gb-runner*** Directory | |
|main.tf |EC2 machines intialization and configuration along with configuring security groups and ebs volumes |
|backend.tf|Here we initialize the s3 backend that store the state remotely, and expose the remote state to be used from s3|
|output.tf |Here we specify the output of the module after applying changes) | 
|vars.tf |Here we declare and initialize variables used by the ec2-gb-runner module) |
|provider.tf |Here Set the provider to AWS |
|scripts | Initialization script to be executed in provisioned ec2 instances on launch through cloud-init ec2 user-data, init.tpl will execute a bash script that handles installing docker and gitlab runner and registering runners with gitlab projects/groups|



## Getting Started

-  make sure you have terraform installed (www.terraform.io)
-  Make Sure to have AWS credentials and set profile in ~/.aws/config and ~/.aws/credentials
- Make sure to have an s3 bucket and give your user needed policies.
-  for changes in the Repo:
  * go to <root>
  * run `terraform init`
  * run `terraform fmt -recursive` to format files
  * run `terraform plan` to make sure nothing unwanted changed
  * do changes
  * run `terraform plan`, make sure it's OK, 
  * run `terraform apply`
## Module Initialization
- Module initialization
```terraform
module "ec2-gb-runner" {
  source       = "./ec2-gb-runner"
  gitlab_token = <Gitlab project or group token>
  runners      = <Number ofrunners to register, default(1)>
  concurrent = <Maximum number of concurrent executing jobs, default(10)>
  runner_url = <Gitlab runner coordinator url in case gitlab hosted in yoru server, default(https://gitlab.com)>
  runner_executor = <docker>
  runner_default_image = <Default image in the runner, default(ruby:2.5)>
  runner_name = <Runner name, default(ec2-gitlab-runner)>
  runner_tags = <Runner tags seperated by ',', default(ec2-gitlab-runner)>
  runner_locked = <Either runner is locked to the project or not, default(false)>
  runner_run_untagged = <Either runner is allowed to run untagged jobs, default(true)>
  tf-bucket = <S3 bucket that host remote state, default(tf-gitlab-ci-runner)>
  tf-state-file = <file name that has remote state in s3, default(terraform.tfstate)>
  profile = <AWS profile name>
  region = <AWS region default(us-east-1)>
}
```
